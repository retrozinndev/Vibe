# Build Scripts
This directory includes some scripts to help building Vibe.

I do not recommend you to use these scripts directly, instead, please use npm commands(e.g.: `npm run build`, `npm run start`).

> [!note]
> The `sources.sh` script contains utility variables and functions for the helper scripts
