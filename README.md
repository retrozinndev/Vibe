In-development Music Player made with Adwaita.

> [!warning]
> This is still in development and doesn't work yet!

## Goals
- Play(and maybe stream) music
- Work with MPRIS Interface
- Use TypeScript and [Gnim](https://github.com/aylur/gnim) with GJS
- Internationalization (i18n)
- Pretty attractive but familiar interface
- Plugin support (for adding new sources and more...)
